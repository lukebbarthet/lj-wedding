    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <div class="story-block">
      <h3>Luke and Julia</h3>

      <p>
        Every love story has its own journey, and ours is made up of the moments, choices, and experiences
        that have brought us here — some planned, some a little unexpected, and all of them memorable.
      </p>

      <p>
        We first met back in sixth form, sharing a few experiences and a little mild chaos along the way —
        nothing serious at the time, but enough to leave a lasting impression. After school, we went our
        separate ways to explore different paths at university, only to find that life had a way of
        bringing us back together.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we reconnected, everything just clicked, and we officially started our relationship.
        Since then, our journey has been full of adventure and growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've shared countless experiences together — from travelling to new places to spontaneous little
        adventures — all of which have brought us closer and shaped our lives together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, we moved in together and created a home filled with love, comfort, and everyday moments
        that make life so special.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, we're preparing to celebrate our wedding surrounded by all of you, our family and friends.
        We can't wait to dance, share stories, and make unforgettable memories together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for being part of our story — the best is yet to come! 💍✨
      </p>

      <h3>The Proposal</h3>

      <p>
        Three years into our relationship, Luke completely caught Julia by surprise with a proposal
        in a vineyard in Tuscany, set within an old Medicean villa.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a little sparkle and an unforgettable smiling “yes!” — a perfect moment we'll always remember.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now, exactly three years later, we're tying the knot, ready to begin the next chapter of our story
        surrounded by our family and friends.
