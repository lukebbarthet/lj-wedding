    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <div class="story-block">
      <h3>Luke and Julia</h3>

      <p>
        Every love story has its own journey, and ours is shaped by the moments, choices, and experiences that brought us here — some planned, some unexpected, and all unforgettable.
      </p>

      <p>
        We first met back in sixth form, sharing a few experiences and a little mild chaos before heading off on separate paths at university. Life had other plans, and when we reconnected, everything just clicked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, our journey has been full of adventure — from travelling and spontaneous experiences to building a home together filled with love and everyday moments that mean the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, we are so excited to celebrate our wedding with all of you. Thank you for being part of our story — the best is yet to come! 💍✨
      </p>

      <h3>The Proposal</h3>

      <p>
        Three years into our relationship, Luke surprised Julia with a proposal in a vineyard in Tuscany, set within an old Medicean villa.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It was a moment filled with joy — and an unforgettable smiling “yes” — one we will always treasure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Now, exactly three years later, we are tying the knot and beginning the next chapter of our story, surrounded by our family and friends.
